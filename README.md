Simple Webcam Streaming with OpenCV and UDP using Python
To use it, you have to install OpenCV on your computer.
for more information about OpenCV goto http://opencv.org
numpy is also required.

I use openCV to capture image from my webcam, and compress it
to jpeg and save it to local directory.

To make my application simple, I use OpenCV built in function
imshow() to display the video.

The other part of my application is simply UDP Socket programming.

In conclusion, it is a simple demo application mainly aiming at
solving the problem.
